## Create Card

In the page Create Card, you can search for pictures using the Pixabay API. When you pick one by clicking on it,

the chosen picture is featured at the top of the page. Then you can write the content of the card, and your name.

If you already wrote your name in the input field in the front page, it will be shown in the Create Card page automatically.
